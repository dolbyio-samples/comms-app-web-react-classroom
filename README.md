# Dolby.io Classroom App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Ensure that you enter in your Dolby.io Credentials in `/src/utils/voxeetUtils.js`. That is, replace the placeholder text in:
```js
const consumerKey = '<DOLBYIO_COMMUNICATIONS_API>';
const consumerSecret = '<DOLBYIO_COMMUNICATIONS_SECRET>';
```
with the credentials from your application, found here: https://dolby.io/dashboard/applications/summary
